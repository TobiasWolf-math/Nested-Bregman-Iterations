This is the code with which the numerical results in Section 6 of the paper "Nested Bregman Iterations for Decomposition Problems” by T. Wolf, D. Driggs, K. Papafitsoros, E. Resmerita and C.-B. Schönlieb were obtained using Matlab version 23.2.0.2409890 (R2023b) Update 3.” To conduct the experiments and create the images from section 6.2 run the file test_morozov_nested.m in the folder H^1-L^1. To run the file, the following package is needed: “CVX: Matlab Software for Disciplined Convex Programming” ( https://cvxr.com/cvx/ ).  To create the data used in Section 6.3 run the file Nested_Bregman_data.m in the folder H^1-TV. The corresponding plots are created by the file make_plots.m. To create the data used in Section 6.4 run the file TGV_Nested.m in the folder OscillationTGV. The corresponding plots are created by the file make_plots.m. For the experiments yielding Figure 4 run the file test_variational.m. For the experiments yielding Figure 4 run the file test_Nested_vs_Variational.m. Attention, the latter two files have a very long runtime.
